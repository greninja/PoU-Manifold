The data points are uniformly distributed on a unit sphere.
To generate these 3-dimensional points, we first generate standard
normally distributed points as vectors lying in 3D space, and then
normalize these vectors (X:= X / ||X||) to make it lie on a sphere
(S^2) which acts as an embedded manifold in 3-D ambient space.
